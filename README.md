In the `Landmarks` app, a user can flag their favorite places, and filter the list to show just their favorites. To create this feature, you’ll start by adding a switch to the list so users can focus on just their favorites, and then you’ll add a star-shaped button that a user taps to flag a landmark as a favorite.

# 1. [Mark the User’s Favorite Landmarks](https://github.com/c4arl0s/handlinguserinput#handlinguserinput---content)

# Step 1

Open the project you finished in the previous tutorial, and select `Landmark.swift` in the Project navigator.

# Step 2

Add an `isFavorite` property to the Landmark structure. 

The `landmarkData.json` file has a key with this name for each landmark. Because `Landmark` conforms to Codable, you can read the `value` associated with the `key` by creating a new property with the same name as the key.
